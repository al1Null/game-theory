(a) Suppose that player A uses strategy i half of the time, strategy iii half of the time, and strategy ii none of the time. Suppose also that player B uses each of the four strategies one fourth of the time. Find the expected payoff of the game. 
(b) If player B keeps his strategy the same as in part (a), what strategy should player A choose to maximize her expected payoff? 
(c) If player A keeps her strategy the same as in part (a), what strategy should player B choose to maximize his expected payoff?

  Two clothing stores in a shopping center compete for the weekend trade. On a clear day the larger store gets 60% of the business and on a rainy day the larger store gets 80% of the business. Either or both stores may hold a sidewalk sale on a given weekend, but the decision must be made a week in advance and in ignorance of the competitor’s plans. If both have a sidewalk sale, each gets 50% of the business. If, however, one holds the sale and the other doesn’t, the one conducting the sale gets 90% of the business on a clear day and 10% on a rainy day. It rains 40% of the time. How frequently should each retailer conduct sales?

The game is tied with half a second left, but a penalty is called and the kicker is kicking the shot that will decide the match. He can kick it high or low. The goalie must anticipate whether to block the ball high or low. Neither player can know for certain what the other will do. If the kicker kicks high with the goalie blocking high, the kicker has 70% chance of scoring. Alternatively, the kicker could kick low and if goalie blocks low, the kicker has 60% of scoring that point. If the goalie blocks low while the kicker kicks high, there is only 40% chance the kicker will win. Similarly, blocking high on the chance the kicker kicks low, the kicker has a 50% of scoring. Find the optimal strategy for each the kicker and the goalie.
